This Jupyter Notebook project contains a machine learning classification model which predicts whether a patient with some given health feature values is likely to have diabities or not.

The file has multiple boxes, which should be run in order in Jupyter Notebook. Here you can find a tutorial on how to run a Jupyter Notebook project https://youtu.be/r8BXJdE9ChE?si=lSu5zIOUttVggt0r, but there are plenty other tutorials on Youtube. Note that you should first clone the repository on your machine and install all libraries. There are 520 input data examples, each with their own features (input) and their class (no/yes) - denoted by 0(no diabities) or 1(diabities) (output) given in a csv file. The data is taken from Kaggle :https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/early-diabetes-classification. The user can also see the training, cv, and test errors and then can input some personal features and run the model to predict if the patient whith those feature values is likely to have diabities or not. All the other details of the structure and the algorithms are explained next to the code in every box.

Classification errors appear as numbers in the interval [0,1] and they represent a percentage of misclassified data (eg 0.12 -> 12% error or 0.4301 -> 43% of data is missclassified).

The project is inspired by algorithms and ideas presented in the "Machine Learning Specialization" course, by Andrew Ng, from the Coursera official website. 
THIS PROJECT IS JUST EXPERIMENTAL, DO NOT RELY ON ITS RESULTS IN THE REAL WORLD.
